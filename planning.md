# Covid-19 Analysis

My overall plan for this project is to first get plotly dash up and running and display the data from all the different files in their as a overview. Once that is done, i will arrange multiple menus and implement the geojson map which is Choropleth with colors based which counties have the most cases and deaths. Map be fully interactive so on clicks you can see the amount of cases and deaths. 

* Data available to visualize 
  
  * Gender Data
  
  * Municipality Weekly Data
  
  * National Daily Deaths
  
  * National Daily ICU Admissions
  
  * National Total Deaths By Age Group
  
  * Regional Daily Cases
  
  * Regional Totals Data

* Dashboard
  
  * Plotly Dash
  
  * Plotly Dash Bootstrap Components
  
  * Include Plotly Express graphs
  
  * Use a Choropleth map over the swedish counties (geojson) map.
  
  * Make it interactive, let the user choose what to visualize, maybe (buttons, dropdowns, lists) ?


* Notes:

  * Needed to edit the geojson file to correct names of the counties to match with my Reginal_Totals csv file
